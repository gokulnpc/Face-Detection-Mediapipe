# Face Detection using OpenCV and Mediapipe

This project employs the MediaPipe library and OpenCV for real-time face detection. Leveraging a webcam feed, it accurately identifies and annotates faces within the frame. Utilizing MediaPipe's Face Detection module, it detects faces and draws bounding boxes around them, along with confidence scores. Additionally, the system calculates and displays the frame rate, ensuring smooth performance.
